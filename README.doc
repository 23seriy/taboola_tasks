Solution: 
Clone the git@github.com:23seriy/taboola_tasks.git
cd taboola_tasks

Task 1:
1. 
cd task1
taboola_access_log_analysis_ex1.sh ftp://ita.ee.lbl.gov/traces/NASA_access_log_Jul95.gz

2. 
cd task1
taboola_access_log_analysis_ex2.sh ftp://ita.ee.lbl.gov/traces/NASA_access_log_Jul95.gz

Task 2: 
a.
cd task2
./taboola_second_task.py

b. In order to verify the userÂ­events sending mechanism of the widget I would use Selenium to run repeatable tests against the widgets.
You can record different scenarios(with Selenium IDE) and the compare the collected information with the parsed access log of Nginx. 

It is very flexible framework compatible with many browsers.

Task 3: 
How to push a small change to the git repo: 
1. Download attached tab00la_calc.pem to your home directory
2. chmod 600 ~/tab00la_calc.pem
3. To clone the https://github.com/23seriy/tab00la_calc execute:
PKEY=~/tab00la_calc.pem git clone ${YOUR_USER}@github.com:23seriy/tab00la_calc.git
4. cd tab00la_calc
5. Do your changes, i.e. add new file 'test':
touch test
6. Commit the changes:
	git add test
	git commit -m "add new test"
7. git pull 
8. git push

My assumptions: 
Task 1
1. Download the log file each time you run the script (in case the file can be changed)
2. The format of the log can not be changed
3. Page views - All requests of kind GET and POST.
4. Recognizing the list of broken and/or relocated urls by requests with responses different of "200". 

Task 2
1. Recognizing the "click" event by looking for the 'click?pi' string in each row of the log file.
