# executing the script:  taboola_access_log_analysis_ex1.sh ftp://ita.ee.lbl.gov/traces/NASA_access_log_Jul95.gz

My assumptions: 
Task 1
1. Download the log file each time you run the script (in case the file can be changed)
2. The format of the log can not be changed
3. Page views - All requests of kind GET and POST.
4. Recognizing the list of broken and/or relocated urls by requests with responses different of "200".
